# raku-dash-docset

This is a slightly modified version of the documentation for the [Raku programming language](https://raku.org/), copied from the HTML docs at https://rakudocs.github.io/.

I'm using [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) to build a dash docset from this HTML.

When the docset is done, I will contribute it to the [repo for user-contributed docsets](https://github.com/Kapeli/Dash-User-Contributions).

Besides Dash, you can use [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) --- which is free software --- to read docsets.
