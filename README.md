# raku-dash-docset

This is a dash docset for the [Raku programming language](https://raku.org/), built from the HTML docs at https://rakudocs.github.io/

I used [dashing](https://github.com/technosophos/dashing) to build this docset.

Use [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/) --- which is free software --- to read docsets.
